 Generate HTML with vtk.js to visualize sliced rotor data

        Load data:
        - Load from http://127.0.0.1:5000/dataset/rotor.vti

        Processing:
        - Slice ：Set as active scalar "Pressure"
        - Applies a Y-axis slice at 80% /depth (setSlice, setSlicingMode).
        Visualization:
        - Maps pressure values to colors (blue→white→red gradient) and opacity (full opacity).
        - UI: Adds an orientation marker (XYZ axes) for spatial reference.
        6. No GUI controls required

Create vtk.js visualization for isabel.vti dataset with velocity field.

        Load data from: http://127.0.0.1:5000/dataset/isabel.vti

        Generate streamlines from center seeds, show outline.

        Use vtkFullScreenRenderWindow and load vtk.js from CDN.
        

Result: Filter-ImageStreamline
Visualizes a 3D vector field using `vtkImageStreamline` for streamlines, `vtkOutlineFilter` for data bounds, and seed points, with interactive resolution controls.

IO-HttpdatasetReader
Loads and visualizes a 3D model (VTP format) from a remote URL using `vtkHttpDataSetReader` with gzip support.

Rendering-GlyphMapper
Visualizes a 3D plane with glyphs (e.g., cones) whose scale and orientation are based on scalar and vector data, using `vtkGlyph3DMapper` and `vtkCalculator`.

Rendering-SphereMapper
Visualizes a 3D sphere generated by `vtkSphereSource` and rendered with `vtkSphereMapper`.

Rendering-VolumeMapper
Loads a 3D volume dataset and renders it using `vtkVolumeActor` and `vtkVolumeMapper` with extensive customization for appearance and quality.

Rendering-StickMapper
Creates a 3D visualization where a plane is rendered using a `vtkStickMapper`. The plane's geometry is generated with a `vtkPlaneSource`, and `vtkCalculator` processes the data to generate custom point attributes ('orientation', 'temperature', 'pressure') which `vtkStickMapper` uses to control the orientation and scaling of the sticks. The visualization is displayed in a full-screen renderer with a dark background. Additionally, UI controls allow adjusting the X and Y resolution of the plane, which dynamically updates the visualization.
