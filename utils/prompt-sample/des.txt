---

### IO-OBJReader
Loads and renders a 3D OBJ model with its associated MTL materials using `vtkOBJReader` and `vtkMTLReader`, allowing mesh part visibility toggling.

---

### IO-PDBReader
Loads a PDB file (caffeine molecule) and visualizes it with `vtkPDBReader` and `vtkMoleculeToRepresentation`, showing atoms as spheres and bonds as sticks.

---

### IO-PolyDataReader
Loads and visualizes a 3D polygonal data file (`test_cone.vtp`) using `vtkXMLPolyDataReader` and `vtkMapper`.

---

### IO-Screenshot
Renders a 3D sphere and captures the canvas as a PNG image (`IO-Screenshot.png`).

---

### IO-StickMapper
Generates a plane and uses `vtkCalculator` to create custom point data ('orientation', 'temperature', 'pressure'), which `vtkStickMapper` could use for rendering (currently not fully connected).

---

### IO-XMLImageDataWriter
Loads 3D volume data, writes it to a binary XML format using `vtkXMLImageDataWriter`, reads it back with `vtkXMLImageDataReader`, and visualizes it.

---

### IO-XMLImagePolyDataWriter
Loads 3D polydata, writes it to a string using `vtkXMLPolyDataWriter`, reads it back with `vtkXMLPolyDataReader`, and renders it, allowing download of the generated VTP file.

---

### Rendering-GlyphMapper
Visualizes a 3D plane with glyphs (e.g., cones) whose scale and orientation are based on scalar and vector data, using `vtkGlyph3DMapper` and `vtkCalculator`.

---

### Rendering-Image2D
Displays a synthetic 2D image generated by `vtkRTAnalyticSource` using `vtkImageMapper` and `vtkImageSlice`.

---

### Rendering-ItkWasmVolume
Loads a medical image dataset (MHA) and renders it as a 3D volume using `vtkVolumeMapper` with custom color and opacity transfer functions.

---

### Rendering-ManyRenderers
Displays multiple interactive 3D objects (cone, sphere, cube, cylinder) in separate, independently styled renderers with animation and layout adjustments.

---

### Rendering-StickMapper
Creates a 3D visualization where a plane is rendered using a `vtkStickMapper`. The plane's geometry is generated with a `vtkPlaneSource`, and `vtkCalculator` processes the data to generate custom point attributes ('orientation', 'temperature', 'pressure') which `vtkStickMapper` uses to control the orientation and scaling of the sticks. The visualization is displayed in a full-screen renderer with a dark background. Additionally, UI controls allow adjusting the X and Y resolution of the plane, which dynamically updates the visualization.
