 Generate HTML with vtk.js to visualize sliced rotor data

        Load data:
        - Load from http://127.0.0.1:5000/dataset/rotor.vti

        Processing:
        - Slice ：Set as active scalar "Pressure"
        - Applies a Y-axis slice at 80% /depth (setSlice, setSlicingMode).
        Visualization:
        - Maps pressure values to colors (blue→white→red gradient) and opacity (full opacity).
        - UI: Adds an orientation marker (XYZ axes) for spatial reference.

```

Detailed Steps:
1. **Introduce necessary VTK.js modules via the CDN link**: 
   - Include the VTK.js library by adding `<script src="https://unpkg.com/vtk.js"></script>` in your HTML file to access its functionalities.

2. **Data Loading — Load the VTK dataset**:
   - Use `vtkXMLImageDataReader` to fetch and parse the dataset from the specified URL (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/dataset/rotor.vti`). This step involves creating an instance of the reader, setting the URL, and then updating it to read the data into memory.

3. **Data Processing — Set 'Pressure' as the active scalar and apply a slice**:
   - After loading the data, configure the active scalar to 'Pressure'. Then, create a slice filter (e.g., `vtkImageSlice`) and apply it along the Y-axis at the 80% depth mark. This involves setting up the slicing mode and position correctly.

4. **Visualization Setup — Map pressure values to a color gradient**:
   - Utilize `vtkColorTransferFunction` and `vtkPiecewiseFunction` to define a color map that transitions from blue to white to red based on the pressure values. Ensure full opacity is applied by configuring the opacity transfer function accordingly. Connect these functions to the mapper associated with your actor.

5. **Add UI Element — Integrate an XYZ axes orientation marker**:
   - Incorporate an orientation marker into the scene to provide spatial context. This can be achieved by using `vtkOrientationMarkerWidget` combined with `vtkAxesActor`. Configure the widget to display the XYZ axes effectively within the rendering window.

6. **Integrate all components and render the visualization**:
   - Assemble the renderer, actors, and other components into a `vtkRenderWindow`. Render the scene using `vtkRenderer` and `vtkActor` without including any additional GUI controls as per the requirement. This final step ensures everything is displayed correctly and efficiently.
