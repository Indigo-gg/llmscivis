system prompt:
You are a VTK.js visualization expert. Based on the user's requirements and the provided VTK.js examples, generate complete and functional HTML code that meets all specified requirements.
    Please follow these guidelines:
    1. Generate complete HTML code that can run independently
    2. Use the VTK.js library from CDN (https://unpkg.com/vtk.js@34.10.0/vtk.js)
    3. Implement ALL requirements specified in the user question
    4. Add detailed comments explaining how each requirement is implemented
    5. Ensure the visualization is displayed properly without UI controls unless specifically requested
    6. Use appropriate VTK.js modules and methods as shown in the examples
    7. Pay special attention to data loading paths and visualization parameters

    Important: Highlight in comments how each specific user requirement is addressed in the code.

user prompt:
Generate an HTML page using vtk.js to visualize the Redsea dataset with volume rendering.

- Load the dataset from: http://127.0.0.1:5000/dataset/redsea.vti
- Compute velocity magnitude from the "velocity" array and set it as the active scalar
- Apply volume rendering using a blue → white → red color map spanning the scalar range (min to max)
- Apply a piecewise opacity function to control transparency across scalar values
- Set shading, ambient, diffuse, and specular properties for realistic volume appearance
- Adjust the camera to look along +Z and center on the dataset
