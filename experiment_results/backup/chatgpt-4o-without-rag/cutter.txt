user prompt:
Generate an HTML page using vtk.js to visualize the rotor dataset.

- Load the dataset from: http://127.0.0.1:5000/dataset/rotor.vti
- Set the active scalar array to "Pressure".
- Apply a slice along the Y axis at 95% depth of the dataset (convert percentage to slice index).
- Use a blue → white → red color map for pressure values, spanning from the minimum to maximum scalar range.
- Set opacity to fully opaque (no transparency variation).
- Add an orientation marker with XYZ axes in the bottom-right corner.
- No interactive GUI controls are required.
