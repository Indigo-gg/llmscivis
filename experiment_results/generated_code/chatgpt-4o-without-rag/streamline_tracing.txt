user prompt:
Generate an HTML page using vtk.js to visualize the Isabel dataset with streamline rendering.

- Load the dataset from: http://127.0.0.1:5000/dataset/isabel.vti
- Use the "Velocity" array as the vector field for streamlines
- Generate seed points at the center of the dataset with sufficient density to cover the domain
- Compute streamlines following the velocity field
- Render streamlines in cyan ([0, 1, 1]) with a specified line width
- Render a dataset outline in red ([1, 0, 0]) with a specified line width
