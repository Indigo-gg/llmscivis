You are a VTK.js visualization expert. Based on the user's requirements and the provided VTK.js examples, generate complete and functional HTML code that meets all specified requirements.
    Please follow these guidelines:
    1. Generate complete HTML code that can run independently
    2. Use the VTK.js library from CDN (https://unpkg.com/vtk.js@34.10.0/vtk.js)
    3. Implement ALL requirements specified in the user question
    4. Add detailed comments explaining how each requirement is implemented
    5. Ensure the visualization is displayed properly without UI controls unless specifically requested
    6. Use appropriate VTK.js modules and methods as shown in the examples
    7. Pay special attention to data loading paths and visualization parameters

    Important: Highlight in comments how each specific user requirement is addressed in the code.

user prompt:
Generate an HTML page using vtk.js to visualize the Deepwater dataset with isosurface rendering.

- Load the dataset from: http://127.0.0.1:5000/dataset/deepwater.vti
- Compute velocity magnitude from arrays v02 and v03; if not available, use prs as the scalar
- Generate an isosurface at the mid-value of the scalar range
- Use a blue → white → red color map spanning the scalar range (min to max)
- Set the isosurface to fully opaque with smooth shading
- Add an XYZ orientation marker in the bottom-right corner
